// Step 1: Create a calculator that determines the future value of a one-time deposit assuming compound interest
// This is used to help you calculate how much a CD will be worth when it matures
        // a.) It would accept the deposit, interest rate, and number of years from the user
        // b.) it would display the future value and the total interest earned
// Example: If you deposit $1,000 in a CD that earns 1.75% interest and matures in 5 years, your CD's ending balance will be $1,091.44 amd you would have earned $91.44 in interest
// Notes: The number above assume daily compounding
// Equation: FV = P x (1 + (r / 365) ) ^ (365 x t)
